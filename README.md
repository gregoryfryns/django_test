================================

This is a little Django test that turned into my personal webpage. Feel free to copy and reuse!

Here are some details about the applications you'll find here:

- *polls*: this application is the one explained in the Django tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial01/). It shows how to get data from a form and store it in a database, and how to retrieve data from the database and display it on a web page.
- *weather*: this application is just an example on how to use web services (REST - JSON)
